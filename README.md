## 🧠 About Me

CS undergrad @ Syracuse. I build things that live at the edge of logic and creativity — from LLMs and ML pipelines to VR games and mobile sensing tools. If it blends code with human behavior, I’m probably into it.

## 🔭 Currently Working On

- 🎮 **Library VR Game** – Teaching students how to navigate library resources through gesture-based gameplay (Unity + C#)
- 📱 **Android Health Tracker** – Encouraging outdoor balance with real-time feedback
- 📊 **Depression Detection** – Collecting IMU + audio data to model emotional states (research w/ Prof. Salekin)

## ⚡ Fun Fact

I built a CNN chatbot before I could drive. Now I build tools that sense emotion, teach through VR, and explore the edge of what’s possible with code.
